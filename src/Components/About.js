          Hello! I'm Agustin, an Argentinian web developer. I am currently&nbsp;
          {ageInYears} years old and have a degree in Industrial Engineering
          from the National University of Tucum√°n, Argentina. After finishing my
          degree and studying some programming concepts for industrial
          equipment, I decided to delve deeper into this world. I began by
          completing two diploma courses at the National Technological
          University of Argentina, which taught me HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript
          concepts, including libraries like React, as well as Node.js with
          Express.
        </p>

      <p className="secondPart">
        From the moment I started studying programming, I knew that this was
        what I wanted to work on throughout my life. Thus, I dedicated many
        hours of study per week to achieve my goal, supplementing my learning
        with online resources such as www.theodinproject.com, to which I owe
        much of my knowledge. With only the defense of my final project at the
        university remaining, I am looking for a new opportunity that will allow
        me to continue growing in the world of web development. I am currently
        working in a Start up working daily with technologies such as
        Typescript, webpack and Sass and occasionally with React, Python and
        Django.
